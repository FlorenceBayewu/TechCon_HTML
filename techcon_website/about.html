            <h2>History of TechCon</h2>
            <p>
                TechCon began in 2010 as a small gathering of local technologists passionate about open-source software. 
                Over the years, it has grown into a major international event, evolving to cover topics from AI and 
                machine learning to sustainable technology and digital ethics. We are proud of our journey from a 
                community meetup to a global thought leadership platform.
